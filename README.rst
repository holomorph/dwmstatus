dwmstatus
---------

This is yet another branch of the dwm status bar written by Trilby_. This
program sources

* Trilby's dwmStatus_ for audio, cpu, memory, & battery info
* Unia_'s dwm-status_ for mpd support
* The barebone ``dwmstatus`` from suckless_

This program runs with ``dwm-6.0`` patched with statuscolors_, and a terminus_
BDF modified to include pertinent icons. See w0ng's dwm_.

The shell script ``dwmvolume`` uses falconindy's ponymix_ to write a volume
info file to be read by ``dwmstatus``.
