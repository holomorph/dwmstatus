# dwmstatus

This is yet another branch of the dwm status bar written by [Trilby](https://github.com/TrilbyWhite). This script sources Trilby's [dwmStatus](https://github.com/TrilbyWhite/dwmStatus) for audio, CPU, memory, & battery info. This also sources [Unia](https://github.com/Unia)'s [dwm-status](https://github.com/Unia/dwm-status) for mpd support.

This script runs with dwm patched with statuscolors, and a modified terminus2 BDF. See [w0ng's dwm](https://github.com/w0ng/dwm).
